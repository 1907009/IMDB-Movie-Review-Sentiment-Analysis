# IMDB-Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
The IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis mini project is an attempt to use NLP methods to generate sentiments through the reviews and display the same using Flask. 

# Notebook
The Notebook ["Movie Review.ipynb"](https://github.com/1907009/IMDB-Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/Movie%20Review.ipynb) contains the different levels of sentiment analysis right from loading the datasets to model saving and generating the predictions.

# Flask app
The  ["app.py"](https://github.com/1907009/IMDB-Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/app.py) file uses flask to establish a framework to use our program along with two html files namely "home.html" , "result.html" . 

Thank you!!
